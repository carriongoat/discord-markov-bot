### markov chain generator for discord
this was developed in about a week by a programmer and a funny doggy hopped up on vyvanse who was too wired not to try and pull this off. we based this bot's functionality and it's markov chain tuning on genAI, who's death inspired this bot

100% works in linux, never tested in windows but i developed it hoping it would work, mac i have no idea lol. good luck.

everything is plaintext because 1. im scared of xml/json/parsing things intelligently 2. because i wanted stuff to be readable by people so they could read their channel history back and point and laugh at what the bot picked up

help is welcome, send pull requests! if you want to ask me any questions shoot me a text on discord @carrion goat#2637

beware: im not a good programmer and i've never made anything in python before this, unless you count godot games. there may be bad decisions here

### how to use
first you need discord.py and markovify installed on your system. google these their pages have more info on them that you'll want. we wrote this on python 3.10, i dont know the python landscape well enough to know the minimum version this will run on.

run the bot by inserting your bot's key in the last line of main.py, `client.run('here-keep-the-quotes')`, then run main.py
