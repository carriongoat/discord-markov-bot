###markov chain generator for discord


this was developed in about a week by a programmer and a funny doggy hopped up on vyvanse who was too wired not to try and pull this off. we based this bot's functionality and it's markov chain tuning on genAI, who's death inspired this bot

100% works in linux, never tested in windows but i developed it hoping it would work, mac i have no idea lol. good luck.

everything is plaintext because 1. im scared of xml/json/parsing things intelligently 2. because i wanted stuff to be readable by people so they could read their channel history back and point and laugh at what the bot picked up

help is welcome, send pull requests! if you want to ask me any questions shoot me a text on discord @carrion goat#2637


beware: im not a good programmer and i've never made anything in python before this, unless you count godot games. there may be bad decisions here
